        "This notebook shows how to pull plotRes-style spectrograms from Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) using the helper utilities in this repo. It focuses on our parallel submit+poll downloader (which fires multiple ONC jobs, staggers the submissions, and polls for completion before downloading) and walks through the common ways we sample data:\n",
        "\n",
        "* fixed-length windows (sequential span)\n",
        "* sampling between two dates\n",
        "* explicit timestamp lists\n",
        "\n",
        "Along the way we highlight which spectrograms ONC keeps in the archive versus those generated on demand, and how to choose the available plot styles/resolutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "> How it works: the helper submits multiple ONC data-product requests, staggers them a few seconds apart so the backend has breathing room, and then polls `/dataProductDelivery/status` for each run until ONC says the files are ready. Once ready, it downloads the MAT (and optionally FLAC) files. This parallel submit+poll loop typically delivers a 5–6× wall-clock speedup over the strictly sequential waitComplete workflow.\n",
